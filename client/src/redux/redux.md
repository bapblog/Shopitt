# REDUX TOOlKIT

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications that provides a centralized store for the state and a set of rules for updating that state in a predictable way.

In a Redux-powered application, the state is managed in a single store and can only be updated through a set of actions that are dispatched to the store. The state updates are performed by reducers, which are pure functions that take the current state and an action as input and return a new state
